    How does the web work?

<body>

<p1>
    Ever wondered how does a website work ? Let's say you wanted to purchase
    some blue denim jeans, and for that you will quickly open your any browser (ex: brave, firefox, etc)
    and search for the site, for example "Amazon.ca" in this case.
    Do you know how does brave take you to amazon just by searching it with url ?

</p1>

<p2>
    When you search for amazon.ca on brave, you will get a website in the results. Now
    you tap on that. For any company like Amazon, if they wanted it to be listed as a website,
    they need a web server to host their company. so amazon also has a web server.
    And if you have searched for "amazon.ca" in your browser, it means you have some internet facility for your device
    i would call it as ISP (Internet Service Provider). Using your ISP, you will search for a 
    web address or domain like "amazon.ca".

<h2> DNS Server</h2>
<p3>
    Let's say you are doing this in your laptop, now your laptop connects to a group of servers called DNS (Domain Name System) Servers.
    Here you can find all the servers that were hosted. Now lets imagine just like you
    "amazon.ca" website is hosted on a laptop. Now if you want to connect to that web server.
    you need to know the IP address of their laptop on which "amazon.ca" is hosted.

</p3>
<h2> IP Address</h2>
<p4>
    you might be thinking, there are trillions of websites in this world. Then all those websites have their own IP addresses ?
    Yes, all those websites have their own unique IP addresses. An IP address is a number with 12 digits. It usually has full stops in it.
    Ok wait. now what are we discussing ? Ah.. Ip address, so you need to know the IP address of "amazon.ca"
    The DNS Server, to which your laptop was connected to reveals the IP address of "amazon.ca".
</p4>
<h2>Web Server</h2>
<p5>
    Once the DNS Server has given you the IP address. Then you can easily contact the web server of ("amazon.ca").
    you might be thinking, what could be a web server ?
    A web server is a computer, that is continuously stays connected to the web. So that
    when a user searches for "amazon.ca", such that it shows the concerned web page to the user.
